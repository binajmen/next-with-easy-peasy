# With Redux Wrapper + Easy-Peasy Example for Next.js

Usually splitting your app state into `pages` feels natural but sometimes you'll want to have global state for your app. This is an example on how you can use easy-peasy that also works with the universal rendering approach from Next.js.

## How to use

Clone this repo, install dependencies and you're all set:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Notes

## TODO's
